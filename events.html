                            <p class="event-container-discription mt-3">The IEEE SPS Day- Deep Oscillatory Neural Networks
                                For Signal Processing was conducted on 24th May 2024 by the SPS student chapter at the ECE
                                seminar hall. There were 53 participants from BME, ECE department. The event started at
                                10:00 AM. Dr.V.Srinivasa Chakravarthy, Professor, Dept. of Biotechnology, IIT Madras delved
                                into a cutting-edge intersection of neuroscience-inspired algorithms and signal analysis.
                                Then we were briefed about the advantages of DONNs over traditional neural networks,
                                highlighting their robustness to noisy and non-stationary signals, as well as their potential
                                for learning complex temporal patterns. He also gave a novel approach to processing time-series
                                data, particularly in fields like speech recognition, image processing and biomedical signal
                                analysis. He explained how DONNs utilize deep learning techniques to extract hierarchical
                                features from signals, while also leveraging oscillatory dynamics to enhance model performance.
                                The session was informative and fun and the professor taught good and at a pace we could all
                                keep up and understand.</p>

                            <p class="event-container-discription mt-3">Dr. Akihiko (Ken) Sugiyama, currently with Yahoo! JAPAN
                                Research, is a prominent figure in signal processing, particularly in audio coding and noise control.
                                His distinguished career includes a lengthy tenure as a research engineer at NEC Central Research
                                Laboratories and various key roles in the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS).</p>
                            <p class="event-container-discription">Day 1 began with a slide presentation focused
                                on a three-point analysis, which was elucidated using various examples and
                                demonstrations. Following a tea break, participants were tasked with assignments.
                                They were instructed to independently choose a research paper,
                                analyse its contents, and complete the assignment that consisted of Value,
                                Trick and Problem, thus effectively evaluating the chosen paper. Dr. Sugiyama
                                later reviewed these assignments, addressing any doubts and offering fresh insights and ideas.</p>
                            <p class="event-container-discription">On Day 2, the session started with an introduction to the
                                principles of graph design and valuable tips for effective drafting. The participants were then
                                assigned a fresh set of assignments aimed at testing their comprehension and application of the
                                newly acquired knowledge. Additionally, the significance of crafting a well-structured abstract was
                                emphasized, and this critical skill was revisited and reviewed later in the session to ensure its
                                importance was thoroughly understood by all participants.</p>
                            <p class="event-container-discription">The short course also had a Distinguished Lecture (DL)
                                on "Personal Information Devices". The DL had over 60 participants from various field of interest.
                                The talk was truly captivating and offered a profound insight into the fascinating history of various
                                devices. It skilfully unravelled the evolution of these devices, providing a comprehensive perspective
                                on how they have transformed over time. Various technologies such as Audio encoding and decoding were
                                explained to the participants.</p>

                                an overview of hardware support from MATLAB and Simulink. Participants were treated
                                to a demonstration showcasing the interfacing capabilities of MATLAB and Simulink
                                with devices like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. The hands- on sessions were particularly
                                lauded by the attendees, who found them both informative and fascinating.</p>
